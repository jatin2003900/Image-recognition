# Image-recognition
Implemented an Image Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python. The project accurately classifies and detects images, leveraging deep learning techniques for feature extraction and pattern recognition. Demonstrated skills in machine learning, neural network design, and Python-based data analysis.


This project uses deep learning to recognize and classify images using a custom-built CNN model. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it handles data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction with high accuracy.
